# Polynomial Regression in Python
This project demonstrates how to perform *Polynomial Regression* using scikit-learn with synthetic sample data.
## ðŸ“Œ What is Polynomial Regression?
Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable X and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial.
## ðŸ§¾ Code Description
### ðŸ”§ Libraries Used
- numpy for numerical operations
- matplotlib for plotting
- scikit-learn for model training and polynomial feature transformation
### ðŸ“ˆ Dataset
Hardcoded sample data:
```python
X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
y = [2.5, 3.6, 7.4, 11.2, 19.3, 29.4, 39.5,Â 52.3,Â 70.5]
